Tempo Gradient was built as a tool for musical practice. Its purpose is to help musicians learn passages of music through repetition, which gradually gets faster according to the parameters set by the user.

## Usage

How to use is hopefully self-evident. Enter the starting the tempo (bpm) and ending tempo (bpm) and specify a duration. Click 'Play' to start the metronome.

Duration input is strictly minutes. 3:30 minutes must be input as 3.5. I might change this in a later iteration.

If users want to use this as a standard, static metronome, they can just enter a starting tempo and leave the other fields blank.

## Version History

**1.0 - 9/6/20**
<br>

- Tempo shifting
- Three different sounds
- Loop option
- Beat option
- Works as standard metronome

Working well on laptop, but only about 80 - 90% performance when testing on Pixel 2 mobile phone--the intervals between beats isn't 100% accurate, not sure if this is an issue with my code or simply the phone's lesser power. That said, it's still usable and helpful through mobile.

## Roadmap

The next minor update(s) will be to enhance performance of basic functionality on mobile. Not sure if I'll seek to add more features.
